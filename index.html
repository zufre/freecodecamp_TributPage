            <p>Scott Jurek's outstanding competitive resume includes victories in nearly all of ultrarunning's elite trail and road events, including the historic 153-mile Spartathlon, the Hardrock 100, the Badwater 135-mile Ultramarathon, the Miwok 100K,
              and—his signature race—the Western States 100 Mile Endurance Run, which he won a record seven straight times. The Washington Times named him one of the top runners of the decade, Runner's World awarded him a Hero of Running and Ultrarunning
              Magazine named him Ultra-Runner of the Year three times. In 2010, he set a new US all-surface record in the 24-Hour Run with 165.7 miles—6.5 marathons in one day—for which he was named USA Today's Athlete of the Week. </p>
            <p>On his first attempt, in 2005, he set a course record in the Badwater Ultramarathon, 135 miles through the 130 degree heat of Death Valley. 2006 saw a repeat Badwater victory and his first of three wins at the Spartathlon in Greece, which traces
              the legendary run of the Greek herald Pheidippides from Athens to Sparta. Scott was the first North American winner of the Spartathlon and still holds the three fastest times on the course behind the legendary Yiannis Kouros. In 2007, he set
              a new course record at the Hardrock Hundred, a grueling course through Colorados San Juan Mountains featuring over 33,000 feet in cumulative elevation gain. Running is a solo sport requiring intense mental focus, but Scott's victories would
              have been impossible without the selfless support of his crew, pacers, sponsors and his dedicated fans. Scott makes his home near the peaks of Boulder, Colorado. When he isn't running, he might be Nordic skiing, cycling, backpacking, doing
              trail maintenance, practicing yoga, or preparing vegan delicacies in his kitchen. Scott is an avid reader who draws inspiration from Native American traditions, the running warriors of ancient Greece, and the samurai code of Bushido. Scott
              feels that if he helps just one person heal themselves through diet and exercise, he will have won the race.
            </p>
            <p>More than just a champion, Scott is a true student and ambassador of the sport, known to stay at finish lines cheering until the last runner crosses. A passionate advocate for vegetarianism, he follows a 100% plant-based diet, which he credits
              for his superior endurance, recovery and overall health. He believes that everyone can run an ultra and everyone can access their bodys innate capacity to heal. Through writing, public speaking, and consulting, Scott takes joy in encouraging
              people of all fitness levels to take the next step toward vibrant health. Scott grew up hunting, fishing, and running through the wooded trails of his native Minnesota. His first passion was Nordic skiing, and he began running as cross-training
              for the ski season. Everything changed in 1994, when Scott ran his first Minnesota Voyageur with his friend and training partner Dusty Olson. In his first 50-miler, Scott came in second and discovered a hidden taste for ultra long distances.
              While completing his Masters Degree in Physical Therapy from the College of St. Scholastica, Scott continued running and soon began competing worldwide. His growing conviction that processed, low-quality food was keeping his physical therapy
              clients sick led him to adopt a vegetarian diet in 1997, and a purely plant-based one by 1999. From 1999 to 2005, he notched his unsurpassed string of Western States 100 victories, all on plant-based fuel. In 2001 through 2003, he had the
              honor of representing the United States on the winning teams in the OXFAM Hong Kong Trailwalker 100K and the Hasegawa Cup Japan Mountain Endurance Run.
